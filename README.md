I suffer from a chronic case of "f***-ing around & finding out" syndrome,  
which somehow led me from Computer Science lectures to founding Startups to  
organizing FOSS meetups.

These days I'm a full-stack engineer who compulsively switches between  
Python, Go, Dart and whatever language or Framework seems fun that week.

I co-founded Kairo where I built tools that helps gather analytics and user  
feedback from your product, organized the FOSS United chapter in Dehradun to  
spread the open-source faith.

When I'm not maintaining opensource projects or speaking at conferences, you  
can find me playing football, reading about new technologies and adding  
another side-project to my "definitely gonna finish this" collection.
